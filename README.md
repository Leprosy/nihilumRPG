# phaser-project-ts
A basic game project template using TS-Parcel-Phaser

This includes:
* `jest` for testing and coverage.
* `parcel` to do the live server, transpiling of the code and building.
* `Phaser.JS` as the main engine.

WIP: assets need to be copied every time in the `dist/` folder for now.

# Usage
Just clone the damn thing, run `npm install` and start hacking ðŸ˜Š
